# Adaptive Multimodal Continuous Ant Colony Optimization

## Overview

The Adaptive Multimodal Continuous Ant Colony Optimization (AM-ACO) algorithm aims to address the challenges of seeking multiple optima simultaneously in multimodal optimization problems. This approach leverages the diversity-preservation advantages of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms, extending them with adaptive parameter adjustments and enhanced exploitation techniques to effectively handle complex multimodal landscapes.

## Features

- **Adaptive Parameter Adjustment**: Dynamically adjusts algorithm parameters based on niche diversity, improving optimization efficiency across varied problem landscapes.
- **Differential Evolution Mutation**: Integrates a differential evolution operator to accelerate convergence towards promising regions of the search space.
- **Local Search Scheme**: Employs a Gaussian distribution-based local search around niche seeds to refine solutions and enhance exploitation capabilities.
- **Extensive Benchmarking**: Validated against 10 widely used benchmark multimodal functions, demonstrating competitive efficiency and effectiveness in complex scenarios with high numbers of local optima.
